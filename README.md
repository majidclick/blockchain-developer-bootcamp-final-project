# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project idea
Hello guys! I am Majid, founder of PerOneX, an affiliate platform.
I am looking for a team (back & front developer or full stack, marketing manager and a graphist) in order to do this (please use your browser built-in translator):
https://t.me/PerOneXAffiliateChat/5

also, for my bootcamp final project I want to do something like attrace (https://attrace.com/) to submit affiliate transaction of my platform on blockchain

could u guys help me with that? and any way to connect my current website to bootcamp final project?

Simple Workflow
1.	Users (Companies, Marketers and Customers) will have to register themselves somehow on the contract (ideally it is better we can use current Ethereum’s accounts as our user accounts and assign related mentioned roles to them) 
note: Identity managing is the key to be a worldwide cross-chain platform …
2.	Companies will run their campaigns and also share their product/services on platform (currently please see my WordPress site: http://market.peronex.ir)
3.	Marketers have to identify which campaign, product/service they are affiliating on (ideally it should be possible users can get their affiliate links on any campaign & product/services so they can share it anywhere such as their socials)
4.	when a customer/buyer buys a product/service or interact with a campaign, it should be possible to track from which affiliate it is (currently on my site I use a powerful affiliate manager plugin) and submit this transaction on blockchain
note: there is a return purchase issue in this business that for this bootcamp project I am not sure we can consider it …
there are another two important issues which I think should be submitted on blockchain that we ignore for now: 
1.	Submit reviews and comments
2.	Submit score Points

All of other issues and part of project I think we can handle non-blockchain way

Regards!

currently the main pain in affiliate marketing is the ability of affiliate platform/plugin owner/runner to change the result of happened buying activities and show to the marketer that there was no successful payment or say to marketer return purchase occured ... there is no way to trust the process for marketers ... I am not a technical person so maybe there are better ways to handle trust at this case ... (maybe even liquidity pools are an option or a must in this process) but I see platforms like attrace (blockchain affiliate & refferal platform) and revain (user reviews on blockchain)
So I really appreciate brainstorming and your technical comments in order to help me do the things I wrote in my first message in an affordable, logical and operational way ...


Contain a README.md file which describes the project, describes the directory structure, and where the frontend project can be accessed (see #8). Please also include your public Ethereum account if you would like to receive your certification as an NFT (this is optional). 

Hosted on Github Pages, Heroku, Netlify, Fleek, Surge or some other free frontend service that gives users a public interface to your decentralized application. That address should be in your README.md document.

In your README.md, be sure to have clear instructions on: 
Installing dependencies for your project 
Accessing or—if your project needs a server (not required)—running your project
Running your smart contract unit tests and which port a local testnet should be running on.
Note: This section used to require three bash scripts but has been revised.

A screencast of you walking through your project, including submitting transactions and seeing the updated state. You can use a screenrecorder of your choosing or something like Loom, and you can share the link to the recording in your README.md
